My thoughts

1. Leaving the sphere initialization + clamping is best, converges faster, other methods just give rise to several other issues and the convergence is slower
2. I kept the random initialization and guassian denoising because, we all agreed to implement it. 
3. All methods might eventually form the hole, just that it requires longer epoch. 
4. The chamfer loss is key to the hole formation, without it it just doesn't work irrespective of the initialization
5. Using bigger learning rate (1e-3) is best, others are too small for convergence

NOTE
Runs on wandb are only tested for complete runs, if you use large epochs like 1000, the trainning stops at 600+, the resulting model will be good, but test evaluation
won't be recorded on wandb

Working solution
Chamfer distance + clamping sdf values using torch.clamp() + sphere initialization
